# Exploratory Data Analysis With Movies.


## Project Overview

This analysis explore what type of films are doing well in the market, and provides the findings to Microsoft's new movie studio executives to help in their data driven decision making as they venture into the movie industry.For this project, i have used exploratory data analysis to generate insights from the IMDB movies dataset.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data
I utilized three different data from IMDB 'ZippedData' for my analysis in order to have a more comprehensive dataset.

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

## Methods

This project uses exploratory analysis, including correlation between different variables in the data set. This provides a useful insights on the movies dataset

 The genre with the higest domestic gross is Animation.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, I would recommend that Microsoft release one of the following 3 movies:

1. Animation films because it the most profitable in average.

2. Science Fiction films being the most popular genre and it is the second most profitable genre.

3. Drama films have a positive correlation with most variables like revenue, ratings and number of votes making it,
   a good genre to invest in.
